# ARM-LEG Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

Your company, DarkHawk727, is a renowned platform that offers an ARM-LEG Simulator, a Pseudo-ARM Assembly Simulator written in `Python`. The simulator assists users in understanding the nuances of assembly programming, thereby contributing significantly to the learning curve of budding programmers and professionals alike.

As a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with an extensive background in Python and assembly programming, I am confident that my experience and skills align well with your requirements. Most notably, I  have already developed a similar project named ARM-LEG Simulator as part of  my coursework. This project involved writing a CLI program following the best practices of modular Python design and Object-Oriented Design principles. Additionally, I have added a test suite using `pytest` and linting using ruff, integrating them into GitHub Actions.

During my tenure as a Full-Stack Web Developer at Starai Tutoring, I honed my skills in JavaScript (React.js) and Bulma.css. My experience with these technologies, along with my proficiency in `Git`, Google Cloud Platform (`Firebase`), VS Code, `PyCharm`, `IntelliJ`, could be beneficial for improving the user interface of the ARM-LEG Simulator.

In the same vein, my passion for self-learning has led me to complete the Machine Learning Specialization and Deep Learning Specialization from Stanford Online + Coursera. The insight gained from these courses, particularly in neural networks, decision trees, clustering, and anomaly detection, could be utilized to incorporate AI features into the ARM-LEG Simulator, thereby enhancing its functionality.

I look forward to the possibility of contributing to DarkHawk727. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique blend of skills and experience to your team and believe could add significant value to your innovative efforts.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
