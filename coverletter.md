Qualcomm Canada ULC  
Interns Group, Interns Group  
Interim Engineering Intern - HW

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Interim Engineering Intern - HW position at Qualcomm Canada ULC, as listed on your careers page. As a current Bachelor of Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with a strong focus on machine learning and web development, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Qualcomm’s innovative projects, particularly in the areas of deep learning and neural network architecture.

Your emphasis on inventing technologies for a connected future resonates deeply with my professional pursuits and academic background. At Starai Tutoring, I honed my skills in JavaScript and React.js while developing a responsive multi-page website. This experience aligns with Qualcomm’s commitment to leading-edge technology and inventive solutions.

My project experience, including the Deep Work Tracker and the Personal AI web applications, demonstrates my proficiency in Python and neural networks, key requirements for the role. Specifically, my use of GPT-4 in the Personal AI project speaks directly to your need for experience with auto-regressive language models. Additionally, my involvement in a wide range of machine learning areas, as evidenced by my completion of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specializations on Coursera, has equipped me with a strong foundation in Pytorch and neural network architecture development, aligning well with the job’s minimum qualifications.

I am particularly excited about the possibility of contributing to Qualcomm’s exploration of end-to-end learning in neural networks. My educational journey at the University of Waterloo and my self-learning initiatives have been driven by a similar passion for exploring the frontiers of AI and machine learning.

Moreover, my personal achievements in Hackathons, including being a 2x Google Cloud Prize Recipient, showcase my innovative thinking and ability to deliver results in competitive environments, qualities I understand are valued at Qualcomm.

I am available for either the Winter or Summer Co-op terms and am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining Qualcomm, a pioneer in driving the technologies of the future. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills, experience, and passion for technology align with the needs of Qualcomm.

Sincerely,

Arjun Sarao
